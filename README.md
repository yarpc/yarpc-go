A message passing platform for Go that:

* Supports multiple encodings like [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
* Enables multiple transports like [HTTP/1.1](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), and [TChannel](https://github.com/uber/tchannel).
* Allows messages to be sent directly and through queues like [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [Cherami](https://eng.uber.com/cherami/).

High-level features are implemented *above the wire*, enabling:

* Exposing a server over multiple transports simultaneously.
* Migrating outbound calls between transports with just config changes.
* Middlewares that work even as the encoding and transport vary.

## Installation

We recommend locking to [SemVer](http://semver.org/) range `^1` using [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide):

```
glide get 'go.uber.org/yarpc#^1'
```

## Stability

This library is `v1` and follows [SemVer](http://semver.org/) strictly.

No breaking changes will be made to exported APIs before `v2.0.0` with the
**exception of experimental packages**.

Experimental packages reside within packages named `x`, and are *not stable*. This means their
APIs can break at any time. The intention here is to validate these APIs and iterate on them
by working closely with internal customers. Once stable, their contents will be moved out of
the containing `x` package and their APIs will be locked.
