- [ ] Strike ResponseWriter out, use *yarpc.Response directly.
      - [ ] Fix inbound middleware
      - [ ] Fix inbound transports
      - [ ] Consider creating a unified Unary or Caller interface that can be
            used for both inbound and outbound unary.
      - [ ] Consider removing Body from Request and Response entirely, making
            them positional, to avoid separating and embedding Meta* for the
            streaming case.
- [ ] Change Request and Response body to yarpc.Buffer type
      - [ ] Accumulate request bodies at the inbound
- [ ] yarpcrouter.Router needs to accept middleware to decorate registered
      procedures.
- [ ] Replace functional options in yarpcpeerlist with struct options
- [ ] Create an API in yarpcfx to register and obtain peer lists by name.
      Use this API to configure the chooser for an outbound in their transport fx package.
      Use this API to send updates from a peer list updater to a peer list in the updater fx package.
- [ ] yarpchttp needs to subsume responsibility for validating requests instead
      of leaving that to middleware registered in the dispatcher.
- [ ] Consider renaming HandlerSpecs to Routes
- [ ] Fix round robin tests, relaxing its requirements regarding lifecycle
      ordering, perhaps taking availability changes into account.
- [ ] Audit yarpcerrors, remove the ones that are no longer needed.
- [ ] Construct PRs with retroactive continuity.
- [ ] Nit: scrape name pid and change to just id throughout.
- [ ] Audit docs

Encodings:
- [x] Drop raw encoding
- [x] Port JSON encoding
- [ ] Port Thrift encoding
- [ ] Port Protobuf encoding

Transports:
- [ ] Port TChannel transport
- [ ] Port or recreate gRPC transport

To port peer lists forward:
- [ ] Replace functional options with options struct pattern, like net in the
      go standard library and the v2/yarpchttp example.
- [ ] Remove lifecycle.
- [ ] Drop Config and Spec, recreate in yarpcfx.

To port transports forward:
- [ ] Rename Transport to Dialer, implementing yarpc.Dialer.
- [ ] Decouple Inbound and Outbound from Transport. The Dialer gives outbounds
      access to the underlying transport if that's needed to convey disconnect
      messages back.  Inbounds have no need for the dialer.
- [ ] Remove lifecycle.
- [ ] Inbounds should have Addr and Listener properties, favoring the open Listener if given.
- [ ] Outbounds should have URL/Addr, Dialer, and Chooser properties, favoring the Chooser if given.
- [ ] NewSingleOutbound should be removed in favor of Outbound{Dialer, Addr or URL} as an alternative
      to providing a chooser.
- [ ] Start/Stop must accept context, return error.
- [ ] Replace functional options with options struct pattern, like net in the
      go standard library and the v2/yarpchttp example.
- [ ] Transports() method is no longer required.
- [ ] Reduce the Connecting peer connection status to simply Unavailable.
- [ ] Clean up free variables that refer to dialers. What was trans, x, or transport can now be just dialer.
- [ ] Remove all references to the raw encoding in tests, which no longer exists.
- [ ] Stop with context should block until context expires or all connection management goroutines conclude.
- [ ] Nit: reg as a free variable should be renamed router.
- [ ] Audit docs
- [ ] Nit: eliminate use of "." imports for yarpctests.
- [ ] Replace the Dispatcher throughout tests with a yarpc.Router or yarpc.Config as needed.
- [ ] Subsume validation instead of depending on the dispatcher to add validator middleware.

To port encodings forward:
- [ ] Accept yarpc/v2.Client instead of yarpc.ClientConfig + yarpc.Outbounds.
- [ ] Create new codegen target for yarpc/v2
- [ ] New encodings must accept middleware stack in client constructor
- [ ] Replace the Dispatcher throughout tests with a yarpc.Router or yarpc.Config as needed.
- [ ] Audit docs
- [ ] Nit: eliminate use of "." imports for yarpctests.
