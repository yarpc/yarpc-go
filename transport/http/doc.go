// Package http implements a YARPC transport based on the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
// The HTTP transport provides first class support for Unary RPCs and
// experimental support for Oneway RPCs.
//
// Usage
//
// An HTTP Transport must be constructed to use this transport.
//
// 	httpTransport := http.NewTransport()
//
// To serve your YARPC application over HTTP, pass an HTTP inbound in your
// yarpc.Config.
//
// 	myInbound := httpTransport.NewInbound(":8080")
// 	dispatcher := yarpc.NewDispatcher(yarpc.Config{
// 		Name: "myservice",
// 		Inbounds: yarpc.Inbounds{myInbound},
// 	})
//
// To make requests to a YARPC application that supports HTTP, pass an HTTP
// outbound in your yarpc.Config.
//
// 	myserviceOutbound := httpTransport.NewSingleOutbound("http://127.0.0.1:8080")
// 	dispatcher := yarpc.NewDispatcher(yarpc.Config{
// 		Name: "myclient",
// 		Outbounds: yarpc.Outbounds{
// 			"myservice": {Unary: myserviceOutbound},
// 		},
// 	})
//
// Note that stopping an HTTP transport does NOT immediately terminate ongoing
// requests. Connections will remain open until all clients have disconnected.
//
// Configuration
//
// An HTTP Transport may be configured using YARPC's configuration system. See
// TransportConfig, InboundConfig, and OutboundConfig for details on the
// different configuration parameters supported by this transport.
//
// Wire Representation
//
// YARPC requests and responses are sent as plain HTTP requests and responses.
// YARPC metadata is sent inside reserved HTTP headers. Application headers
// for requests and responses are sent as HTTP headers with the header names
// prefixed with a pre-defined string. See Constants for more information on
// the names of these headers. The request and response bodies are sent as-is
// in the HTTP request or response body.
