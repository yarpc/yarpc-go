// Package peer contains components for managing peers.
//
// The `go.uber.org/yarpc/api/peer` package provides the corresponding
// interfaces that these components implement.
//
// The HTTP and TChannel `NewOutbound` methods accept a `peer.Chooser`.
// To bind an outbound to a single peer, pass a `peer.NewSingle(id)`.
//
// To bind an outbound to multiple peers, you will need a peer list, like
// `roundrobin` (to pick the least recently chosen peer) or `peerheap` (to
// choose the peer with the fewest pending requests).
// Assuming you choose `peerheap`, to bind multiple peers you would pass
// `peer.Bind(peerheap.New(transport), peer.BindPeers(ids))`.
//
// Each transport can define its own domain of peer identifiers, but most will
// use a host:port address for the remote listening socket.
// The `"go.uber.org/yarpc/peer/hostport"` package implements the common
// `hostport.PeerIdentifier` and `hostport.Peer`.
