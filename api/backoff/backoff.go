package backoff

// Strategy is a factory for backoff algorithms.
// Each backoff instance may capture some state, typically a random number
// generator.
// The strategy guarantees that these backoff instances are either
// referentially independent and lockless or thread safe.
//
// Backoff strategies are useful for configuring retry loops, balancing the
// need to recover quickly against denial of service as a failure mode.
type Strategy interface {
	Backoff() Backoff
}

// Backoff is an algorithm for determining how long to wait after a number of
// attempts to perform some action.
// Backoff strategies typically use a random number generator that uses some
// state for feedback.
// Instances of backoff are intended to be used in the stack of a single
// goroutine and must therefore either be referentially independent or lock
// safe.
