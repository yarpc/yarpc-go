// Package interpolate provides a generic mechanism to interpolate variables
// into strings.
//
// Variables are specified in the form "${foo}". Values for the different
// variables are supplied by a VariableResolver function provided at
// render-time. Variable names can also be in the form "${foo:bar}" where
// everything after the ":" is the default value for that variable if the
// VariableResolver did not have a value for that variable.
