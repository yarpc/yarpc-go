// Package reflection exposes information about protobuf services required to
// implement the gRPC server reflection API and return information about the
// compatible registered yarpc services.
//
// The `ServerReflectionInfo` structs should be generated and populated from
// the `protoc-gen-yarpc-go` plugin for each service.
//
// For more information on gRPC server reflection, see
